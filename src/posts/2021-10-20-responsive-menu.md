# Create a mobile responsive navbar in 2021

### By James Pickering

A well designed responsive navbar can support a user experience that works well on a desktop or mobile device from a single codebase. It's a useful skill to have and will help you demo all kinds of nav menus.

Front-end UI frameworks and many thousands of npm packages available today offer impressive features out of the box. When today's version of Bootstrap you've been relying on doesn't cut it anymore, try making a habit out of experimentation. Then apply what you learned as your working method. Study Github source code from courses but aim to understand what your code is doing under the hood.

###Â Challenge yourself
Software developers embrace the chance to take on a challenge and by doing so discover new ways of making things work. This trait makes me and others like me, highly sought after wherever information systems are in big demand across emerging platforms. It helps enormously to shake up your own daily workflow now and then to figure out what parts are stale or need rethinking.

By now you'll have realised with a dash of learning and perseverance you can make your own custom design. Spend some time writing semantic html, css and loosely coupled javascript. Use the tools and methods when it works out best. Aim to write reusable code to drop into future projects. In the hopefully not too future you can recreate it with ease and earn money for it as part of your repertoire.
